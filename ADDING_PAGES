= Adding pages to the PyG3T and PoProofRead webpage =

== Add and entry in the navigation menu ==

The first step in adding a page to the website is to add it to the
navigation menu on the left. It is auto-generated from a hierarchy
described in php as an array of associative arrays, where the key is
the name and the value is the link.

To add a page:
1. Open the file "common.php"
2. Find the variable $menu in the function title_and_navigation
3. Add you page at the appropriate placement as Array("Name" => "link")

If the page that you are adding is not a part of the main page theme,
e.g. if it is auto-generated HTML documentation, then that is al that
is required.

== Making a new page ==

To add a page to the site that will have the same theme as the rest
there is a minimal amount of "boiler plate" code that must be
added. This is already present in the file "template.php", so to form
a new page you need only copy this file and name the copy as your new
page.
